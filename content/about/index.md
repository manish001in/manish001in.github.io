Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Manish** - a software developer, self-proclaimed nerd, and curious cat who's been building software for over **9 years**. My career has been all about chasing interesting ideas with outsized impact, primarily in the startup world where I can truly own products and make a difference.

### The Real Story

Well, I started off as a humble dev, mostly self taught. It definitely defined my personality in terms of how I approach problems. I like to go deep into libraries and frameworks to understand them. I like to build end-to-end, from deploying the code, the proxy to setting up the CI/CD pipeline.

Over time, coding got boring till I saw more to it than CRUD. I saw its potential to impact people's lives and actually make a difference. I started building products that I wanted to use which led to me embarking on my journey as a founder.

While the startup didn't work out, the learning was second to none. I built a ton of products, enjoyed the fruits of a good feedback/critique and got to work with some really smart people.

Now, I'm seeking my **next exciting opportunity**. I want to work with a team truly passionate about what they are building. I want to be a part of their success.

### What I've Been Up To

<u>**Software Developer - Docsum (Contract)**</u> (Feb 2025 - June 2025)  
Built a scalable async task processing system using Hatchet. Architected external app integrations for Google Drive, OneDrive etc. Also created knowledge graphs to find connections between documents using pgRouting and LLMs.

<u>**Founder - Twing**</u> (Dec 2022 - Jan 2025)
Remember when I said I hate "work about work"? Well, I built a whole startup around solving it. Twing was my attempt to make people more productive and less stressed through AI-powered tools like:
- **TwingBot** - An AI Slackbot that saves teams 30+ minutes daily on task management
- **Legaling** - RAG-based legal research platform (because legal research shouldn't be soul-crushing)
- **TwingParse** - AI document extraction that is fire and forget
- **TwingTranslate** - Translation system for Indian languages (it's really hard to find a good one for Indian languages)

<u>**Technical Lead - SalaryBox**</u> (Apr 2022 - Jul 2022)  
Led a team of 10+ engineers, cut infrastructure costs by 30%, and built notification engines that can handle anything you throw at them.

<u>**Senior Software Engineer - Instawork**</u> (Oct 2021 - Apr 2022)  
Built features that increased user engagement by 15% and fraud detection systems (catching the bad guys, one line of code at a time).

<u>**Software Developer - Quadeye Securities**</u> (Feb 2017 - Dec 2020)  
Built real-time trading platforms handling 3000 datapoints/sec. Improved event processing from 5K to 1M events/day because apparently, traders like their data fast.

### The Technical Stuff

I'm language agnostic and handle full-stack development, DevOps, AI applications, mentoring, and product collaboration. My current toolkit includes:

**Languages & Frameworks:** Python, Django, FastAPI, JavaScript/Node.js, Go  
**Cloud & Infrastructure:** AWS, Azure, Docker, because someone has to keep the servers happy  
**AI & ML:** GPT, Claude, Llama, LangChain - basically befriending all the AI models  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, Supabase - storing data like a digital hoarder  

### When I'm Not Coding

Here's where the nerd flag flies high:
- **Warhammer, LOTR, Star Wars** - I've probably spent more hours dreaming about these universes than touching grass
- **Legos & Board Games** - Because building things and strategic thinking aren't just for work
- **Coffee** - The developer stereotype exists for a reason
- **Geopolitics, History, Science** - I find the patterns in how the world works fascinating
- **Productivity optimization** - Yes, I'm that person who has tried every productivity app ever made

### My Philosophy

I believe technology should make life better, not more complicated. Whether it's reducing unnecessary server costs, building AI tools that actually help people, or creating systems that let teams focus on what matters - I'm driven by the idea that good engineering can reduce stress and increase joy in work.
